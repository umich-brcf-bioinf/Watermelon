Column name	Example	Description
test_id	NR_001463	A unique identifier describing the transcipt, gene, primary transcript, or CDS being tested
ncbi_gene_link 	Xist	Link to NCBI gene details
gene_symbol 	Xist	NCBI Gene Symbol (from Entrez gene_info)
gene_id	213742	NCBI Gene ID (from Entrez gene_info)
gene_desc 	inactive X specific transcripts	Gene Description (from Entrez gene_info)
locus	chrX:103460372-103483233	Genomic coordinates for easy browsing to the genes or transcripts being tested
sample 1	Control	Label (or number if no labels provided)
sample 2	Treated	Label (or number if no labels provided)
status 	OK	Can be one of OK (test successful), NOTEST (not enough alignments for testing), LOWDATA (too complex or shallowly sequenced), HIDATA (too many fragments in locus), or FAIL, when an ill-conditioned covariance matrix or other numerical exception prevents testing
value_1 	34.799	FPKM of the gene in sample_1
value_2 	11260.700	FPKM of the gene in sample_2
log2(fold_change) 	8.338	The (base 2) log of the fold change (sample_2/sample_1)
test stat	11.514	The value of the test statistic used to compute significance of the observed change in FPKM
p_value	5.00E-05	The uncorrected p-value of the test statistic
q_value	5.75E-03	The FDR-adjusted p-value of the test statistic
significant	yes	Can be either "yes" or "no", depending on whether p is greater then the FDR after Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple-testing
linear_fold_change 	323.594	The linear fold change (2^log2(FPKMy/FPKMx)
diff_exp 	Yes	Can be either "Yes" or "No"; Yes if the following criterion are met: (Test Status OK) AND (q_value <= 0.05) AND (linear_fold_change >= Threshold or <= 1/Threshold, where Threshold = linear fold change threshold  e.g. 1.5)
